# From Attention to Focus: Building Reliable Agents

**TL;DR:** Practical patterns to make LLM agents more reliable. Covers attention limits, goal drift, context saturation, and fixes that actually ship.

## Abstract
LLM agents fail in boring ways: they lose the thread, wander from goals, and choke on long context. This note maps the failure modes and offers simple, testable fixes: tighter objective scaffolds, focus windows, task chunking, guardrails, and evaluation loops. The aim is less theory, more reliability.

**Keywords:** agents, LLM, reliability, scaffolding, evaluation
